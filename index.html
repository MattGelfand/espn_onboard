					<p class="subtext-lrg">ESPN’s “SportsCenter” app, released nearly one year ago, was an update to a previous incarnation called “ScoreCenter,” the worldwide leader’s scores-only application.  While reviews of ScoreCenter were generally well-received, ESPN wanted to provide users with a more branded experience, creating something that is <a href="http://frontrow.espn.go.com/2013/11/inside-the-new-sportscenter-app-maximizing-the-mobile-experience/">“only doable by ESPN.”</a>.  This meant moving beyond just scores, to news articles from the AP, team beat writers and internal sources, a constantly updated Twitter feed featuring ESPN personalities as well as heavy media inclusion, as much of the content in a user’s “news feed” features video analysis from various ESPN hosts and field reporters.</p> 

					<p class="subtext-lrg">Fresh Tilled Soil had already harbored a personal relationship with Michael Rawlins, ESPN’s Principal User Experience Design Architect (he would speak on a panel at FTS’ annual gathering of UX experts, <a href="http://www.freshtilledsoil.com/uxfest-2014/">UX Fest</a>), which spurred my interest to download the app and see if I could suggest any improvements. However, the design was already slick. There was no glaring need to improve upon the app visually, which, prior to downloading the application, I had intended to do. Despite this hurdle, user testing within the office uncovered some glaring issues in flow, and provided opportunities for improvement beyond the presentation layer.</p>

				<h1 class="text-lrg space-bottom on-black">/ Pivoting /</h1>
 				<p class="subtext-lrg on-black">One of the most intriguing aspects of user testing is the disparity with which different types of users are able to navigate an app or website. A user flow that may seem obvious to the app’s designer or power users can be viewed as a complicated maze by those less familiar or experienced with the given genre of app. “SportsCenter’s” user testing flipped the script - those who followed sports with regularity tended to become frustrated quicker with the tasks asked of them.</p> 
				<p class="subtext-lrg on-black">In hindsight, this makes sense; sports fans are immediately privy to which sports, teams and news they want to see, and which they’d rather ignore. “SportsCenter” greets all users with a melting pot-style news feed of every major (and not so major) sport as the home screen, turning the discovery process into a game of “what buttons do I have to press to customize this thing,” as opposed to a blank slate that allows you to curate your own feed from the start (see: Bleacher Report’s TeamStream). Figuring out how to include a stronger level of curation while still maintaining the app’s core values of “SportsCenter on your phone” turned out to be a significant challenge.</p>

			<div class="column full">
				<h1 class="text-lrg space-bottom">/ Pain Points /</h1>
 				<p class="subtext-lrg">By the end of testing, I was able to pinpoint which aspects of the app tended to leave users confused or stuck. In most cases, the wording wasn't descriptive enough or there were unneccessary extra barriers to entry.</p>
				
				<div class="circle-list">
					<ul class="list">
						<li>
						<img src="img/circletwo.png" alt="" />
						<h1 class="text-md">Now</h1>
						<p class="subtext-md">A few people thought it would be a filtered view of games already in progress. One user called it “useless,” as it interrupted his discovery process to finding his favorite teams. Turns out, it’s the Twitter feed.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
						<img src="img/circlethree.png" alt="" />
						<h1 class="text-md">Favorites</h1>
						<p class="subtext-md">The app gives users the option to view news of specific teams their fans of, but the process of getting to that point (and returning once you’ve ventured elsewhere) isn’t intuitive.</p>
						</li>	

						<li>
						<img src="img/circleone.png" alt="" />
						<h1 class="text-md">Inbox</h1>
						<p class="subtext-md">Generally confusing and poorly named, it’s where a stream of news from all your favorite teams are housed. Not a single user initially recognized this as its purpose.</p>

				<h1 class="text-lrg space-bottom">/ The Iteration Process /</h1>

				<p class="subtext-lrg">Having discovered specific pain points in discovery rather than design flaws, it became clear by the end of testing that some form of user onboarding was in order to prime users on how to use these features. Utilizing sites such as Mobile-Patterns.com and uxarchive.com for inspiration and the fantastic useronboard.com to discover best practices, I began fleshing out ideas for instructions, ultimately testing out two different styles: A pre-use experience where the app’s main features are broken down prior to actual use versus in-app onboarding learn-by-doing process that provides pre-baked instructions as a user clicks on certain areas of the app.</p> 

				<figure class="stages contain">
					<img src="img/placeit-stages.png" id="placeit" alt="">
					<figcaption>The original version was too cluttered, and drew the eye to too many places. The second iteration was cleaned up with a black overlay more typical seen in onboarding processes, and the arrow is more refined. The final version utilized a background blur effect refined the arrow even more and showed users entire sections instead of peepholes.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p class="subtext-lrg">
				Ultimately, I settled on a hybrid of both, allowing the user to get a taste for the app via choosing his or her favorite teams, followed by a prompt to sign up and dig deeper into the meat of the app. By having the user take significant action on the app (i.e. choosing three teams) before jumping into the sign-up / onboard process, a sense of commitment is created that can be followed up on down the line. Foursquare uses a similar process. 
				</p>

 				<p class="subtext-lrg">Determining how the experience would look was mostly a game of trial and error. I knew I wanted to play with overlays and somehow utilize playbook-style arrows to guide users to specific features. Naturally, pairing down and stripping back (along with just the right amount of Gaussian Blur) reaped what I felt to be the best results.</p>

				
				<figure class="stages-final">
					<h1 class="text-lrg space-bottom">/ The Flow /</h1>
 				    <img src="img/trythisnoww.png" class="final-screens" alt="Four screens featuring final onboarding process">
 				    <p class="subtext-lrg">Upon signing in, the user is greeted with a priming screen that explains what he or she is about the see, followed by a breakdown of each of the pain points expressed during the user interviews. By shifting from a dark overlay to a white blur, it became neccessary to provide more context for the user beyond the peepholes.

				<h1 class="text-lrg space-bottom">/ Design is only half the battle /</h1>
 				<p class="subtext-lrg">The user - app relationship is one that must be built on trust. The user took the time (and perhaps money) to download your application, so it’s your job to not betray the user by performing actions without his or her permission. Paramount examples are priming for location - there must be a reason to provide such information. The result of doing so should enhance the app experience in some way, or allow the user to take action. In this case, SportsCenter asks for location so the app can preload user favorites with teams in their area, but unfortunately you can’t access your favorites without signing in first, which, on the surface, feels like a bit of bait-and-switch. The aforementioned process of engaging users by allowing them to choose their teams prior to a sign-up prompt feels like a more user-friendly approach. </p>

			<div class="column full">
				<h1 class="text-lrg space-bottom">/ A bit of maintenance /</h1>
				<p class="subtext-lrg">Aside from guiding users through the main actions of the app via onboarding, some additional minor changes were needed to enhance the discovery experience.</p>

			<div class="column full">
				<h1 class="text-lrg space-bottom">/ A learning experience /</h1>
				<p class="subtext-lrg">Onboarding is a deceptively intricate process, where the primary objective is as much to provide direction as it ease to soothe potential user anxiety and keep them at ease. It can be easy to get lost in the aesthetic polish of an app - and while ESPN did produce a visually pleasing product, what good is it if users quit in frustration before they find the content they’re looking for? User testing provides valuable sets of fresh eyes, and you may want to consider the feedback as an onboarding instruction manual rather than subtitling enacting changes into the app itself.</p>
