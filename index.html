				<h2 class="subtitle caps">A deep dive into ESPN's onboarding process</h2>
				<p class="subtext-lrg">ESPN’s “SportsCenter” app, released nearly one year ago, was an update to a previous incarnation called “ScoreCenter,” the worldwide leader’s scores-only application.  While reviews of ScoreCenter were generally well-received, ESPN wanted to provide users with a more branded experience, creating something that is <a href="http://frontrow.espn.go.com/2013/11/inside-the-new-sportscenter-app-maximizing-the-mobile-experience/">“only doable by ESPN.”</a> This meant moving beyond just scores, to news articles from the Associated Press, team beat writers and internal sources, a constantly updated Twitter feed featuring ESPN personalities as well as heavy media inclusion, as much of the content in a user’s “news feed” features video analysis from various ESPN hosts and field reporters.</p> 

				<p class="subtext-lrg">Fresh Tilled Soil had already harbored a personal relationship with Michael Rawlins, ESPN’s Principal User Experience Design Architect (he would speak on a panel at FTS’ annual gathering of UX experts, <a href="http://www.freshtilledsoil.com/uxfest-2014/">UX Fest</a>), which spurred my interest to download the app and see if I could suggest any improvements. However, the design was already slick. There was no glaring need to improve upon the app visually, which, prior to downloading the application, I had intended to do. Despite this hurdle, user testing within the office uncovered some glaring issues in flow, and provided opportunities for improvement beyond the presentation layer.</p>

				<h1 class="text-lrg caps on-black">Pivoting</h1>
 				<p class="subtext-lrg on-black">One of the most intriguing aspects of user testing is the disparity with which different types of users are able to navigate an app or website. A user flow that may seem obvious to the app’s designer or power users can be viewed as a complicated maze by those less familiar or experienced with the given genre of app. “SportsCenter’s” user testing flipped the script - those who followed sports with regularity tended to become frustrated quicker with the tasks asked of them.</p> 
				<p class="subtext-lrg on-black">In hindsight, this makes sense; sports fans are immediately privy to which sports, teams and news they want to see, and which they’d rather ignore. “SportsCenter” greets all users with a melting pot-style news feed of every major (and not so major) sport as the home screen, turning the discovery process into a game of “what buttons do I have to press to customize this thing,” as opposed to a blank slate that allows you to curate your own feed from the start (see: <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/mobile">Bleacher Report’s TeamStream</a>). Figuring out how to include a stronger level of curation while still maintaining the app’s core values of “SportsCenter on your phone” turned out to be a significant challenge.</p>

				<h1 class="text-lrg caps">Pain Points</h1>
 				<p class="subtext-lrg">By the end of testing, I was able to pinpoint which aspects of the app tended to leave users confused or stuck. In most cases, the wording wasn't descriptive enough or there were unneccessary extra barriers to entry.</p>

							<p class="subtext-md">A few people thought it would be a filtered view of games already in progress. One user called it “useless,” as it interrupted his discovery process to finding his favorite teams. Turns out, it’s the Twitter feed.</p>

						<li>
							<img class="float" src="img/circlethree.png" alt="" />
							<h1 class="text-md caps">Favorites</h1>
							<p class="subtext-md">The app gives users the option to view news of specific teams their fans of, but the process of getting to that point (and returning once you’ve ventured elsewhere) isn’t intuitive.</p>

				<h1 class="text-lrg caps">The Iteration Process</h1>
				<p class="subtext-lrg">Having discovered specific pain points in discovery rather than design flaws, it became clear by the end of testing that some form of user onboarding was in order to prime users on how to use these features. Utilizing sites such as <a href="http://www.mobile-patterns.com/">mobile-patterns.com</a> and <a href="http://uxarchive.com/">uxarchive.com</a> for inspiration and the fantastic <a href="http://www.useronboard.com/">useronboard.com</a> to discover best practices, I began fleshing out ideas for instructions, ultimately testing out two different styles: A pre-use experience where the app’s main features are broken down prior to actual use versus in-app onboarding learn-by-doing process that provides pre-baked instructions as a user clicks on certain areas of the app.</p>

				Ultimately, I settled on a hybrid of both, allowing the user to get a taste for the app via choosing his or her favorite teams, followed by a prompt to sign up and dig deeper into the meat of the app. By having the user take significant action on the app (i.e. choosing three teams) before jumping into the sign-up / onboard process, a sense of commitment is created that can be followed up on down the line. Foursquare uses a similar process. 
				</p>

 				<p class="subtext-lrg">Determining how the experience would look was mostly a game of trial and error. I knew I wanted to play with overlays and somehow utilize playbook-style arrows to guide users to specific features. Naturally, pairing down and stripping back (along with just the right amount of Gaussian Blur) reaped what I felt to be the best results.</p>

				<h1 class="text-lrg caps">The Primary Flow</h1>
				<p class="subtext-lrg">Using Sketch 3 to map out the flow, I added screens to replicate multiple user journeys within the app. By the end it turned into an unwielding labrynth, but with proper labeling and Sketch's pension for quick and easy manipulation, I was able to keep track of each screen and place them accordingly in prototyping tool InVision.</p>

				<h1 class="text-lrg caps">Design is only half the battle</h1>
 				<p class="subtext-lrg">The user - app relationship is one that must be built on trust. The user took the time (and perhaps money) to download your application, so it’s your job to not betray the user by performing actions without his or her permission.</p>

 				<p class="subtext-lrg">Paramount examples are priming for location - there must be a reason to provide such information. The result of doing so should enhance the app experience in some way, or allow the user to take action. In this case, SportsCenter asks for location (above) so the app can preload user favorites with teams in their area.</p>

				<p class="subtext-lrg">Signing up can also become an occasional barrier, especially if there's no option to experiment with the app first to see if it's worth a download. The aforementioned process of engaging users by allowing them to choose their teams prior to a sign-up prompt feels like a more user-friendly approach than the app's current flow of forcing users to sign up in order to populate the list.</p>

				<p class="subtext-med">When users tap the "Favorites" tab, they're is taken to screen to edit their favorite teams. The back button on the top left of the screen does this as well, but its meaning isn't quite as clear, as some testers thought it would bring them back to the home news screen. Adding the word "Edit" clears up any confusion.</p>

				<h1 class="text-md caps text-left">Tap and Remove</h1>
				<p class="subtext-med">One minor but annoying feature when editing favorites is that the chosen team doesn't dissappear from the "Suggested" area once they're chosen, which could lead to an extra tap or two by users who might think their gesture wasn't recognized. They should be removed when tapped, and added back if a user decided to stop receiving news and alerts from that team.</p>

				<h1 class="text-md caps text-left">Semantics</h1>
				<p class="subtext-med">Users can view their favorites at a glance by tapping and holding the "Favorites" tab and then choose which team-specific news to view, which is a nice feature. However, "Favorites" is also reserved for editing teams on tap, which may lead to some conflict. The home "Sportscenter" tab universally represents news, so it makes more sense for the tap + hold gesture to be placed there.</p>

				<h1 class="text-lrg caps">A learning experience</h1>
				<p class="subtext-lrg">Onboarding is a deceptively intricate process, where the primary objective is as much to provide direction as it ease to soothe potential user anxiety and keep them at ease. It can be easy to get lost in the aesthetic polish of an app - and while ESPN did produce a visually pleasing product, what good is it if users quit in frustration before they find the content they’re looking for? User testing provides valuable sets of fresh eyes, and you may want to consider the feedback as an onboarding instruction manual rather than subtitling enacting changes into the app itself.</p>
